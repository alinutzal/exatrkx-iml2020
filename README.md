# Tracking-ML-Exa.TrkX
Building input graphs for Graph Neural Network (GNN) is based on the embedding learning and filtering with multilayer perceptrons, both of which are implemented in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The GNN is implemented in the TensorFlow with the [graph_nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets) package.
