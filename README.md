# Tracking-ML-Exa.TrkX
Building input graphs for Graph Neural Network (GNN) is based on the embedding learning and filtering with multilayer perceptrons, both of which are implemented in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The GNN is implemented in the TensorFlow with the [graph_nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets) package.

## Installation

```bash
conda create --name exatrkx python=3.8

pip install --upgrade pip
```
Dependencies not listed in the `setup.py` are tabulated below. We are referring to their webpage for detailed installation instructions.

* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for embedding learning and filtering
* [torch-geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric#installation) 
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for GNN
* [horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod#install) for distributed training

## Pipelines
The program saves intermediate files after each processing step and we organize those outputs with a predefined structure. The users needs to assign two environment variables: `TRKXINPUTDIR` for tracking input data pointing to the csv files for each event and the `detector.csv` file should be at its uplevel folder; `TRKXOUTPUTDIR` for saving output files.

### Preprocessing
It reads input files, constructs cell features and more importantly figures out truth connections (edges) between hits from the same track.
```run_lightning.py --action build```

### Embedding
It uses the hit position and cell information as inputs and embeds each hit into a hidden phasespace where hits from the same track are clustered together.
```run_lightning.py --action embedding```

### Filtering
It uses multilayer percetrons to filter out as much fake edges as possible while keeping a high efficiency.
```run_lightning.py --action filtering```
